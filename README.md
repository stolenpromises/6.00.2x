# 6.00.2x - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science coursework

This repository contains coursework created as I progressed through MIT's 6.00.2x self paced course. The course expands on the content from 6.00.1x with a continued focus on computation fundamentals and python. A variety of functions commonly used in the data science field are explored along with accompanying theory.
